  <h1>Waffles!</h1>
<p style="color: gray;">The most wonderful of all breakfast foods is the waffleâ€”a ridged and cratered slab of home-cooked, fluffy goodnessthat makes
  every child's heart soar with joy. And they're so easy to make! Just a simple waffle-maker and some batter, and you're
  ready for a morning of aromatic ecstasy!
